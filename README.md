# m68kwb
Homebrew FPGA computer based on MC68000 compatible TG68 core.

The design is using a 32-bit wishbone bus (the TG68 has actually a 16-bit data bus).

Main target platforms:
- Spartan 3 Starter Board
- DE0-CV board from Terasic with an Altera Cyclone V FPGA (when SD-RAM controller is integrated)
